# Delete User Functionality Fix Guide

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
The delete user button was showing success messages and removing users from the UI temporarily, but users were reappearing after page reload. This indicates the deletion was not actually happening in the database due to Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
- **RLS Policies**: Supabase Row Level Security policies were preventing admin users from deleting other users' profiles
- **Permission Issues**: The admin context was trying to delete records directly, but RLS was blocking these operations
- **Insufficient Error Handling**: Errors were being caught but not properly displayed

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Database Function Approach**
Created a secure database function `admin_delete_user()` that:
- Bypasses RLS policies using `SECURITY DEFINER`
- Performs comprehensive cleanup of all user data
- Includes proper admin permission checks
- Provides detailed error handling and logging

### 2. **Files Created/Modified**

#### **New Files:**
- `fix_user_deletion_rls.sql` - Fixes RLS policies for all related tables
- `create_admin_delete_user_function.sql` - Creates the secure delete function
- `DELETE_USER_FIX_GUIDE.md` - This guide

#### **Modified Files:**
- `src/contexts/AdminContext.tsx` - Updated deleteUser function to use RPC call

### 3. **Database Function Features**
```sql
admin_delete_user(p_user_id UUID, p_reason TEXT)
```

**Security Features:**
- ✅ Admin permission verification
- ✅ Prevents self-deletion
- ✅ User existence validation
- ✅ Comprehensive data cleanup
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Transaction safety

**Data Cleanup:**
- Posts
- Messages (sent and received)
- Stories
- Reports (as reporter and reported)
- User restrictions
- Follows (follower and following)
- Likes
- Comments
- User profile

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### Step 1: Run Database Scripts
Execute these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL editor:

1. **First, run the RLS fix:**
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of fix_user_deletion_rls.sql
```

2. **Then, create the delete function:**
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of create_admin_delete_user_function.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Function Creation
Check that the function was created successfully:
```sql
SELECT routine_name, routine_type 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name = 'admin_delete_user';
```

### Step 3: Test the Function
Test with a non-admin user (should fail):
```sql
SELECT admin_delete_user('some-user-id', 'Test deletion');
-- Should return: {"success": false, "error": "Access denied: Admin privileges required"}
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### 1. **Test Admin Deletion**
1. Login as an admin user
2. Go to admin panel
3. Click the delete button (UserX icon) on any user
4. Enter a reason for deletion
5. Click "Delete Account"
6. Verify user is removed from the list
7. **Refresh the page** - user should remain deleted

### 2. **Test Error Handling**
1. Try to delete your own account (should show error)
2. Try to delete a non-existent user (should show error)
3. Test with non-admin user (should be blocked by UI)

### 3. **Verify Data Cleanup**
After deleting a user, check these tables to ensure data is removed:
```sql
-- Check if user's posts are deleted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts WHERE author_id = 'deleted-user-id';

-- Check if user's messages are deleted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM direct_messages WHERE sender_id = 'deleted-user-id' OR recipient_id = 'deleted-user-id';

-- Check if user profile is deleted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles WHERE id = 'deleted-user-id';
```

## 🔍 **Debugging**

### Console Logs
The updated function provides detailed console logs:
- "Starting user deletion for: [user-id]"
- "User deleted successfully: [response-data]"
- Error messages for any failures

### Common Issues

1. **Function Not Found Error**
   - Solution: Ensure `create_admin_delete_user_function.sql` was executed

2. **Access Denied Error**
   - Solution: Verify user has admin privileges in profiles table

3. **User Not Found Error**
   - Solution: Check if user ID is correct and user exists

4. **RLS Policy Errors**
   - Solution: Run `fix_user_deletion_rls.sql` to fix policies

## 🛡️ **Security Considerations**

### What's Protected:
- ✅ Only admins can delete users
- ✅ Admins cannot delete themselves
- ✅ All operations are logged in audit_logs
- ✅ Function uses SECURITY DEFINER for proper permissions
- ✅ Comprehensive data cleanup prevents orphaned records

### Audit Trail:
Every deletion is logged with:
- Actor ID (admin who performed deletion)
- Target ID (deleted user)
- Reason for deletion
- Timestamp

## 📊 **Performance Impact**

### Database Function Benefits:
- ✅ Single transaction (atomic operation)
- ✅ Efficient bulk deletions
- ✅ Reduced network round trips
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Consistent cleanup

### Monitoring:
Check audit_logs table for deletion activity:
```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action_type = 'delete_user' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

1. **Click Delete Button** → Confirmation dialog opens
2. **Enter Reason** → Delete button becomes enabled
3. **Click Delete Account** → User is permanently removed
4. **Page Refresh** → User remains deleted (not restored)
5. **Database Check** → All user data is completely removed

The delete user functionality should now work perfectly with proper database persistence! 🎉
