# üîç Button Debug Test

## Current Issue:
The submit button is not visible in the CreatePost form, even though the code shows it should be there.

## Debug Steps Applied:

### 1. **Enhanced Button Styling**
- Added explicit `display: block`
- Added `visibility: visible`
- Added `minHeight: 50px`
- Added `zIndex: 9999`
- Added `position: relative`

### 2. **Added Fallback Buttons**
- Red "FALLBACK Create Post" button (using Button component)
- Blue "HTML Button Test" button (using native HTML button)
- Both should be visible below the form

### 3. **Added Console Logging**
- `handleSubmit` function now logs when called
- Logs user, subscription, content, image, and NSFW status

### 4. **Added Visual Debug Info**
- Gray box with "Debug: Testing button visibility"
- Should appear below the form

## What to Check:

1. **Refresh the page** and look for:
   - The original gold "Create Post" button in the form
   - The red "FALLBACK Create Post" button below
   - The blue "HTML Button Test" button below
   - The gray debug box

2. **Check browser console** for:
   - "handleSubmit called!" when clicking any button
   - User and subscription status

3. **If NO buttons are visible:**
   - There might be a CSS issue hiding all buttons
   - Check if the CardContent is being rendered
   - Check if there's a z-index issue

4. **If fallback buttons are visible but form button isn't:**
   - There's an issue with the form structure
   - The subscription check might be failing

## Expected Results:
- You should see 3 buttons total
- At least the fallback buttons should be visible
- Console should show debug info when clicking

## Next Steps:
Based on what you see, we can determine if it's:
- A CSS visibility issue
- A form structure issue  
- A subscription check issue
- A component rendering issue
