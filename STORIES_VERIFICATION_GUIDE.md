## 🚨 **If Issues Persist:**

### **Still Getting 400 Errors?**
1. Check if the foreign key constraints were created:
   ```sql
   SELECT constraint_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
   WHERE table_name = 'stories' AND constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY';
   ```

2. Verify the profiles table exists and has data:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;
   ```

### **Stories Not Loading?**
1. Check if stories table has data:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stories;
   ```

2. Verify RLS policies are working:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM stories LIMIT 5;
   ```

### **Rate Limiting Not Working?**
1. Check if the function exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT check_story_rate_limit('your-user-id', 10, 1);
   ```

## 🎯 **Success Indicators:**

### ✅ **Full Success:**
- Stories create without errors
- Stories load in feed
