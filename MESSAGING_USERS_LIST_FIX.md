- **User profiles** with avatars, names, handles, and membership tiers
- **Online status indicators** for each user

#### **User Selection Logic:**
- **Click any user** to start chatting
- **Automatic conversation creation** when clicking a user
- **Existing conversation detection** - if conversation exists, it opens it
