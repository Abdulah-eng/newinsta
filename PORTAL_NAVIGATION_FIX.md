# Fix: Portal Navigation with Subscription Check

## Problem
When users click on "Portal" in the header, it automatically saves Stripe info and marks them as subscribed in the database, then navigates to the portal. Users want it to check if `subscribed` is false first, and if so, navigate to the membership page instead.

## Root Cause
The Header component's "Portal" button was directly linking to `/portal` without checking the subscription status first. This bypassed the subscription check and caused the `checkSubscription` function to run, which created subscriber records.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Header Component
Modified `src/components/Header.tsx` to:
- Import `useNavigate` and subscription state from `useAuth`
- Add `handlePortalClick` function that checks subscription status
- Replace direct Link with Button that calls the function
- Show loading state while checking subscription

### 2. Navigation Logic
```typescript
const handlePortalClick = () => {
  // Check if user is subscribed before navigating to portal
  if (subscribed) {
    navigate('/portal');
  } else {
    navigate('/membership');
  }
};
```

### 3. UI Updates
- Portal button now shows "Checking..." when `subscriptionLoading` is true
- Button is disabled during subscription check
- Both the main Portal button and nav menu "Member Portal" link use the same logic

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ **Subscribed Users:**
- Click "Portal" → Navigate to `/portal` (member portal)
- Access granted to all portal features

### ✅ **Non-Subscribed Users:**
- Click "Portal" → Navigate to `/membership` (membership page)
- Can view membership options and start trial/purchase

### ✅ **Loading State:**
- Button shows "Checking..." while subscription status is being verified
- Button is disabled during the check to prevent multiple clicks

## Files Modified
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Added subscription check before portal navigation

## Testing
1. **Test with non-subscribed user:**
   - Click "Portal" button → Should navigate to `/membership`
   - Click "Member Portal" in nav → Should navigate to `/membership`

2. **Test with subscribed user:**
   - Click "Portal" button → Should navigate to `/portal`
   - Click "Member Portal" in nav → Should navigate to `/portal`

3. **Test loading state:**
   - Button should show "Checking..." briefly during subscription check
   - Button should be disabled during the check

This fix ensures that users are properly redirected based on their subscription status without automatically creating Stripe records or marking them as subscribed.
